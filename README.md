# Breast Cancer Classification Using Neural Networks

This project leverages a neural network model to classify breast cancer cases as benign or malignant. Using clinical data, the model aims to support early diagnosis by accurately identifying cancer types based on various cellular features.

## Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis play a crucial role in effective treatment. This project applies a neural network classifier to predict whether a given tumor is malignant or benign using various features such as cell radius, texture, and smoothness.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) available in `sklearn`. It includes features such as:
- Radius
- Texture
- Perimeter
- Area
- Smoothness

### Target Labels
- **1**: Benign
- **0**: Malignant

## Project Structure
- **DL_Project_1_Breast_Cancer_Classification_with_NN.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **data.csv**: CSV file containing the breast cancer dataset.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
```

## Model Architecture
The neural network is a simple feed-forward model with:
- An input layer that flattens the input features.
- A hidden layer with 20 neurons and ReLU activation.
- An output layer with 2 neurons and sigmoid activation for binary classification.

```python
# Model architecture example
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(30,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(20, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

## Results
The model achieved promising accuracy with the following training setup:
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- Metrics: Accuracy

Accuracy and validation performance were tracked over 10 epochs. The training and validation accuracy plots are shown below.
